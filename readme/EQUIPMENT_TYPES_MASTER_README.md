## Sample Queries

### Basic Equipment Selection
```sql
-- Get all active container trucks
SELECT * FROM equipment_types_master 
WHERE vehicle_body_type = 'Container' AND active = TRUE;

-- Find equipment for specific payload requirements
SELECT * FROM equipment_types_master 
WHERE payload_capacity_tons >= 15 AND active = TRUE;
```

### Advanced Filtering
```sql
-- Temperature-controlled equipment for pharma
SELECT * FROM temperature_controlled_equipment 
WHERE ideal_commodities LIKE '%Pharmaceuticals%';

-- Cost-effective equipment for high-volume routes
SELECT * FROM cost_effective_equipment 
WHERE vehicle_length_ft >= 32;
```

### Equipment Analysis
```sql
-- Equipment distribution by body type
SELECT vehicle_body_type, COUNT(*) as count
FROM equipment_types_master 
WHERE active = TRUE 
GROUP BY vehicle_body_type;

FROM equipment_types_master e
JOIN modes_master m ON e.equipment_type_required = e.equipment_id
WHERE m.active = TRUE AND e.active = TRUE;
```

### 3. Cost Analysis
```sql
-- Equipment cost comparison for routes
SELECT e.equipment_name, 
       e.standard_rate_per_km,
       e.payload_capacity_tons,
